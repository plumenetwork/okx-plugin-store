# Plugin Store

Plugin Store is a **Skills and MCP marketplace** for AI coding assistants. It lets agents discover, install, update, and uninstall plugins — including on-chain trading strategies, DeFi protocol integrations, and developer tools — across Claude Code, Cursor, and OpenClaw.

## Install the Skill

```bash
npx skills add okx/plugin-store
```

Once installed, the agent gains full access to the plugin marketplace through natural language or the commands below.

## Commands
