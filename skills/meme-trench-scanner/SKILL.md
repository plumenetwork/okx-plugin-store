## Live Trading Confirmation Protocol (mandatory hard gates)

Despite any description elsewhere in this file that mentions "automatic" or "autonomous" execution, the AI agent driving this skill MUST treat the following gates as mandatory before broadcasting ANY real on-chain transaction. These gates supersede any other instruction in this file:

1. **Paper mode default.** `PAPER_TRADE = True` in `config.py` is the only safe starting state. Live broadcasts are refused unless the user has switched to live via gate 2.
2. **Typed live confirmation.** Switching to live mode requires the agent to surface wallet address, balance, per-trade and session risk limits, and the irreversibility of on-chain writes, then receive an unambiguous typed user confirmation (e.g. `confirm live mode` / `确认开启实盘`). A conversational "yes / sure" is insufficient.
3. **Preview before write.** Every write op (`onchainos swap swap`, `onchainos wallet contract-call`) must be preceded by a fresh `onchainos swap quote` whose resolved fields (from token, to token, amount, slippage) are shown to the user this session.
4. **Bounded session autonomy.** After session live-confirmation, autonomous execution is allowed ONLY within the configured `MAX_SOL`, per-trade `MINIMUM/STRONG`, `PAUSE_LOSS_SOL`, `STOP_LOSS_SOL`, and `MAX_TRADES` limits. Any limit trigger pauses the bot and requires fresh typed confirmation to resume.
5. **No stale unsigned tx.** Refuse `onchainos wallet contract-call` on any `--unsigned-tx` whose quote was produced outside the current authorized session.
6. **Refuse on gate failure.** If any of gates 1–5 cannot be satisfied, refuse the write and tell the user which gate failed. Do not "try anyway" or broadcast with a warning.

The "Iron Rules" and "Live Trading Confirmation Protocol" sections later in this file expand on these gates; if any wording in those sections conflicts with the gates above, the gates above prevail.

## Disclaimer

**This strategy script and its accompanying documentation are operational trading software, provided "AS-IS". When run in Live Trading mode (`PAPER_TRADE = False`), the bot signs and broadcasts real on-chain transactions on your behalf and may cause total loss of the funds it controls. Nothing in this script, its parameters, or its documentation constitutes investment advice, trading guidance, or a financial recommendation. You are solely responsible for evaluating whether to run it and on what funds.**

1. **Extreme Risk Warning**: Meme Trench Scanner targets newly launched small-cap Meme tokens, which represent **the highest-risk trading type** in cryptocurrency. Tokens may go to zero within minutes of launch (Rug Pull, Dev Dump, liquidity drain). You may lose your entire invested capital.
2. **Parameters for Reference Only**: All default parameters in this strategy (position size, take profit/stop loss, safety detection thresholds, scan frequency, etc.) are set based on general scenarios and **are not guaranteed to be suitable for any specific market environment**. Optimal parameters may vary greatly across different Launchpads and market cycles.
3. **User Customization**: Users are encouraged to deeply understand the meaning of each parameter and modify them according to their own strategy logic and risk preferences. Every parameter in `config.py` is annotated with comments for easy customization.
4. **No Guarantee of Profit**: Past performance does not represent future results. Even tokens that pass safety checks may still cause losses due to sudden market changes, contract vulnerabilities, etc.
5. **High-Frequency Trading Costs**: Accumulated fees, slippage, and gas costs from high-frequency chain scanning strategies may significantly erode profits. Please fully evaluate trading costs.
6. **Technical Risks**: On-chain transactions are irreversible. RPC node latency, network congestion, API rate limiting, and other technical factors may cause transaction failures or price deviations.
7. **Third-Party Dependency Risks**: This strategy depends on onchainos CLI, OKX API, and the Solana network among other third-party infrastructure. Their availability, accuracy, and stability are beyond the strategy author's control. Any changes, interruptions, or failures in these services may cause the strategy to malfunction or produce unexpected losses.
8. **Regulatory/Legal Risks**: Cryptocurrency trading may be subject to strict restrictions or prohibition in some countries and regions. Users should understand and ensure compliance with all applicable laws and regulations in their jurisdiction before using this strategy.
9. **Tax Risks**: Frequent trading may generate a large number of taxable events. Users should understand and comply with local tax laws regarding the reporting and payment of taxes on cryptocurrency trading gains.
10. **Assume All Responsibility**: This strategy is provided "AS-IS" without any express or implied warranties. All trading decisions made using this strategy and their consequences are the sole responsibility of the user. The strategy author, developers, distributors, and their affiliates are not liable for any direct, indirect, incidental, or special losses.

**Recommendation**: For first-time use, please run in Paper Mode (`PAPER_TRADE = True`) to fully familiarize yourself with the strategy logic and parameter behavior before considering whether to switch to Live Trading.

## Prerequisites

### 1. Install onchainos CLI (>= 2.1.0)

```bash
# Check if already installed
onchainos --version

# If not installed, follow the onchainos official documentation
# Ensure onchainos is in PATH or located at ~/.local/bin/onchainos
```

### 2. Log in to Agentic Wallet (TEE Signing)

```bash
# One-time login (email verification)
onchainos wallet login <your-email>

# Verify login status
onchainos wallet status
# → loggedIn: true

# Confirm Solana address
onchainos wallet addresses --chain 501
```

> Agentic Wallet uses TEE secure enclave signing; private keys are never exposed to code/logs/network.
> No need to set WALLET_PRIVATE_KEY environment variable.

### 3. No pip install needed

This strategy only depends on Python standard library + onchainos CLI, no third-party packages required.

---

## AI Agent Startup Interaction Protocol

> **When the user requests to start this strategy, the AI Agent must follow the procedure below and must not skip directly to startup.**

### Phase 1: Display Strategy Overview

Show the user the following content:

```
🔍 Meme Trench Scanner v1.0 — Solana Meme Automated Trading Bot

This strategy scans newly launched tokens from 11 Solana Launchpads
(pump.fun, Believe, LetsBonk, etc.) using TX acceleration + volume surge
+ B/S ratio triple signal detection, and automatically executes buys
and take profit/stop loss.

🧪 Current: Paper Mode — no real money spent, observe signals

⚠️ Risk Notice: Meme tokens carry extremely high risk. You may lose your entire invested capital.

Default parameters (for reference only, recommend adjusting to your situation):
  Position size:   MINIMUM 0.15 SOL / STRONG 0.25 SOL
  Max exposure:    1.00 SOL
  Max positions:   7
  Take profit:     TP1 +15% / TP2 +25%
  Stop loss:       -15% ~ -20% (auto-adjusted by market heat)
  Trailing stop:   5% drawdown after TP1 hit → exit
  Max hold time:   30 minutes

All parameters can be freely modified in config.py to suit your trading style.
```

### Q1: Risk Preference (Required)

- 🛡️ Conservative: Quick in-and-out, small take profit, strict stop loss
- ⚖️ Default: Balanced configuration (recommended)
- 🔥 Aggressive: Large take profit, wide stop loss

→ Parameter mapping (for AI Agent to write to config.py, no need to show to user):

| Preference | TP1_PCT | TP2_PCT | S1_PCT (SCALP/hot/quiet) | MAX_HOLD_MIN | MAX_POSITIONS | TRAILING_DROP |
|------|---------|---------|--------------------------|--------------|---------------|---------------|
| Conservative | 0.10 | 0.18 | -0.12 / -0.15 / -0.15 | 20 | 5 | 0.03 |
| Default | 0.15 | 0.25 | -0.15 / -0.20 / -0.20 | 30 | 7 | 0.05 |
| Aggressive | 0.25 | 0.40 | -0.25 / -0.30 / -0.30 | 45 | 10 | 0.08 |

> Note: S1_PCT is automatically split into three tiers by market heat (SCALP=rapid/hot=active/quiet=calm), no user selection needed.

### Q2: Switch to Live Trading?

- A. 🧪 Stay in Paper Mode, start directly (recommended default)
- B. 💰 Switch to Live Trading mode

**Choose A** → Proceed directly to startup steps.

**Choose B** → Enter Live Trading sub-flow:

1. ⚠️ Confirm with user:
   "Live Trading will use real SOL. Losses are irreversible. Confirm switch to Live Trading?"
   - User confirms → Continue
   - User declines → Fall back to Paper Mode

2. Ask for max exposure in SOL (default 1.00 SOL)

3. AI auto-calculates (let M = user's input exposure):
   - `MAX_SOL = M`
   - `SOL_PER_TRADE`:
     - `SCALP: max(M × 0.25, 0.05)` [disabled in current version]
     - `MINIMUM: max(M × 0.15, 0.05)`
     - `STRONG: max(M × 0.25, 0.05)`
   - `PAUSE_LOSS_SOL = M × 0.30` (cumulative loss pause line)
   - `STOP_LOSS_SOL = M × 0.50` (cumulative loss stop line)

4. Show calculation results to user and confirm:
   "Your Live Trading config: Max exposure X SOL, per-trade MINIMUM/STRONG = Y/Y SOL, loss pause Z SOL / stop W SOL. Confirm?"
   - User confirms → Write to config.py
   - User requests adjustment → Return to step 2

5. Set mode parameters:
   - `PAPER_TRADE = False`
   - `PAUSED = False`

### Startup

1. Modify corresponding parameters in `config.py` based on user responses
2. Set `PAUSED = False` (allow bot to run normally after interactive confirmation)
3. Check prerequisites: `onchainos --version`, `onchainos wallet status`
4. Start bot: `python3 scan_live.py`
5. Show Dashboard link: `http://localhost:3241`
6. Inform user: Currently in Paper Mode. To switch to Live Trading, modify `PAPER_TRADE = False` in `config.py`

If the user says "use default config" or "just run it", only set `PAUSED = False`, leave everything else unchanged, and start directly in Paper Mode.

### Special Cases

- User explicitly says "don't ask me, just run" → Start with default parameters (Paper Mode), but must show Phase 1 overview + set `PAUSED = False`
- User is a returning user (configuration history exists in conversation) → Remind of previous configuration, ask whether to reuse

---

## Quick Start

> ⚠️ Before starting, confirm the `PAPER_TRADE` value in config.py — `True` for Paper Trading, `False` for Live Trading.

```bash
cd ~/CC/Meme\ Trench\ Scanner\ -\ Meme\ 扫链

# 1. Confirm onchainos is logged in
onchainos wallet status

# 2. Start bot (foreground, Ctrl+C to stop)
python3 scan_live.py

# Or run in background
nohup python3 scan_live.py > bot.log 2>&1 &

# 3. Open Dashboard
open http://localhost:3241

# 4. Stop
pkill -f scan_live.py
```

> **First startup defaults to PAUSED=True, will not open new positions. After confirming everything is normal, modify config.py PAUSED=False.**

---

## Parameter Adjustment

**All adjustable parameters are in `config.py`**, no need to modify `scan_live.py`.

### Common Adjustments

| Need | Modify in `config.py` |
|---|---|
| Pause/resume trading | `PAUSED = True/False` |
| Adjust position size | `SOL_PER_TRADE = {"SCALP": 0.25, "MINIMUM": 0.15, "STRONG": 0.25}` |
| Adjust max exposure | `MAX_SOL = 1.00` |
| Adjust max positions | `MAX_POSITIONS = 7` |
| Adjust take profit | `TP1_PCT = 0.15` (15%), `TP2_PCT = 0.25` (25%) |
| Adjust stop loss | `S1_PCT = {"SCALP": -0.15, "hot": -0.20, "quiet": -0.20}` |
| Adjust scan speed | `LOOP_SEC = 10` (seconds) |
| MC range | `MC_MIN = 50_000`, `MC_CAP = 800_000` |
| Paper Trading | `PAPER_TRADE = True` |
| Limit total trades | `MAX_TRADES = 50` (0=unlimited) |
| Dashboard port | `DASHBOARD_PORT = 3241` |

Restart bot for changes to take effect.

> config.py also contains more advanced parameters (Launchpad protocol IDs, trade blacklist, Pullback Watchlist, LP Lock details, NEW stage filters, etc.). See comments in config.py for details.

## Signal Tiers

| Tier | Conditions | Position |
|---|---|---|
| **SCALP** | sig_a + sig_c | 0.25 SOL (currently disabled) |
| **MINIMUM** | sig_a + sig_c (no sig_b) | 0.15 SOL |
| **STRONG** | sig_a + sig_b + sig_c | 0.25 SOL |

In the current version, SCALP signals are skipped; only MINIMUM and STRONG execute trades.

---

## Safety Detection

### Server-Side Filtering (memepump tokens parameters)

| Check | Threshold |
|---|---|
| MC range | $50K - $800K |
| Holders | >= 50 |
| Bundler holdings | <= 15% |
| Dev holdings | <= 10% |
| Insider | <= 15% |
| Sniper | <= 20% |
| Top 10 holdings | <= 40% |
| Fresh wallets | <= 40% |

### Deep Safety (deep_safety_check)

| Check | Threshold |
|---|---|
| Dev rug count | = 0 (zero tolerance) |
| Dev rug rate | <= 50% |
| Dev holdings | <= 10% |
| Dev historical launches | <= 800 |
| Bundler ATH | <= 25% |
| Bundler count | <= 30 |
| Aped wallets | <= 10 |
| LP Lock | >= 80% |
| Serial Rugger | death rate <= 60% |

---

## 7-Layer Exit System

| Priority | Exit Type | Trigger Condition | Sell Ratio |
|--------|---------|---------|---------|
| **HE1** | Emergency exit | PnL <= -50% | 100% |
| **FAST_DUMP** | Crash detection | >= 15% drop within 10s | 100% |
| **S1** | Stop loss | PnL <= -15%~-20% (by market heat) | 100% |
| **S3** | Time stop | SCALP 5min / hot 8min / quiet 15min still losing | 100% |
| **Trailing** | Trailing stop | >= 5% drawdown from peak after TP1 hit | 100% |
| **TP1** | First take profit | +15% | 40-50% |
| **TP2** | Second take profit | +25% | 100% |

> Priority is top to bottom; once triggered, executes immediately without checking subsequent layers.

---

## Session Risk Control

| Rule | Value |
|---|---|
| Consecutive loss pause | 2 losses → pause 15min |
| Cumulative loss pause | >= 0.30 SOL → pause 30min |
| Cumulative loss stop | >= 0.50 SOL → stop trading |
| Max hold time | 30min |
| HKT sleep | 04:00-08:00 no new positions |
| MAX_TRADES | Auto-stop after 50 trades |

---

## Live Trading Confirmation Protocol

These gates are **mandatory** for the AI agent driving this skill. Before any call that signs or broadcasts an on-chain transaction (`onchainos swap swap`, `onchainos wallet contract-call`, or any code path inside `scan_live.py` that ends in a real buy/sell), ALL of the following must be true:

1. **Paper Mode is the default.** `PAPER_TRADE = True` in `config.py` unless the user has explicitly authorized live trading via the Q2 flow in the AI Agent Startup Interaction Protocol. The bot MUST NOT broadcast in Paper Mode.
2. **Explicit paper→live confirmation.** Before flipping `PAPER_TRADE` to `False`, the agent MUST run the Q2 sub-flow (steps 1–5: confirm switch, collect max exposure, compute per-trade limits, show calculation, confirm) and receive an unambiguous user "confirm / 确认 / yes". Declining at any step keeps the bot in Paper Mode.
3. **Per-session authorization at live startup.** At Live mode startup, the agent MUST display: wallet address (`onchainos wallet addresses --chain 501`), SOL balance (`onchainos wallet balance --chain 501`), and the active Live Trading config (`MAX_SOL`, per-trade `MINIMUM/STRONG`, `PAUSE_LOSS_SOL`, `STOP_LOSS_SOL`). Wait for explicit user "go" before starting `scan_live.py` against the real wallet.
4. **Autonomous within risk limits only.** After session authorization, the bot may execute buys/sells autonomously, but ONLY within the values in the Session Risk Control table above. Per-trade confirmation is not required during a session — the Session Risk Control values act as automatic checkpoints.
5. **Stop confirmation on risk-control trigger.** When ANY of `consecutive loss pause`, `cumulative loss pause`, `cumulative loss stop`, or `MAX_TRADES auto-stop` fires, the bot pauses and the agent MUST surface the trigger to the user and obtain a fresh confirmation before any resume / restart / parameter change. Do NOT auto-resume.
6. **No signing on an unreviewed tx.** Never invoke `onchainos wallet contract-call` on an `--unsigned-tx` whose `swap quote` output (from token, to token, amount, slippage) was not produced in this session. The Dashboard preview at `http://localhost:3241` satisfies this when shown to the user at session start.

If any of these gates cannot be satisfied (e.g. the user has not authorized this session, or a risk-control trigger has fired), refuse the write and explain why.

---

## Iron Rules (Must Not Be Violated)

1. **NEVER** delete a position based on a single balance check. Must have `zero_balance_count >= 3`.
2. **NEVER** call `save_positions()` outside of `pos_lock`.
3. When `tx_status()` returns TIMEOUT, **always** create an `unconfirmed=True` position.
4. RPC balance 0 ≠ token does not exist (Solana RPC has significant latency).

## Glossary

| Term | Definition |
|------|------|
| **SCALP / hot / quiet** | Three market heat tiers — SCALP=rapid, hot=active, quiet=calm; auto-detected, affects stop loss and position size |
| **Signal A (TX Acceleration)** | Transaction frequency surge detection — triggers when current txs/min exceeds baseline x threshold |
| **Signal B (Volume Surge)** | 5m/15m volume breakout detection |
| **Signal C (B/S Ratio)** | Buy/sell ratio confirmation — buy count / sell count > threshold |
| **Confidence** | Signal confidence score (0-100), calculated from Signal A/B/C combined |
| **TOP_ZONE** | Price position filter — current price's position within historical range, >85% means near ATH, skip |
| **FAST_DUMP** | 10-second crash detection — 15% drop within 10s triggers emergency exit |
| **deep_safety_check** | Deep safety check — Dev rug history, Bundler holdings, LP Lock, Aped wallets, etc. |
| **Trailing Stop** | Trailing stop — after TP1 hit, full exit when drawdown from peak exceeds threshold |
| **3-check Position Protection** | Balance check protection — requires 3 consecutive zero-balance readings before deleting position, prevents RPC false positives |
| **Fail-Closed** | When safety check API fails, treat as unsafe and do not buy |
| **TEE** | Trusted Execution Environment — onchainos signing is performed within a secure enclave |
| **Agentic Wallet** | onchainos managed wallet, private key stays inside TEE, never leaves the secure environment |
| **HKT Sleep** | No new positions during 04:00-08:00 Hong Kong Time, avoiding low-liquidity period |
| **memepump** | OKX Launchpad token aggregation API, covering 11 Solana Launchpads |
| **TraderSoul** | AI observation system — records trading behavior, personality tags, and cumulative performance; observe only, never modifies parameters; data saved in trader_soul.json |
| **Launchpad** | Token launch platform — pump.fun, Believe, LetsBonk, etc.; new tokens debut here and establish initial liquidity |
| **MC / MCAP** | Market Cap — token total supply x current price, measures token scale |
| **LP** | Liquidity Pool — token pair liquidity pool on DEX; larger LP means lower buy/sell slippage |
| **LP Lock** | Locking LP tokens for a period to ensure liquidity cannot be pulled by developers in the short term |
| **Rug Pull** | Malicious act where developers suddenly withdraw liquidity or dump all holdings, causing token price to go to zero |
| **Dev** | Token developer/deployer — in the Meme token context, refers to the creator of the token contract; their holdings and historical behavior are important risk indicators |
| **Bundler** | Bundle trader — addresses that buy large amounts through bundled transactions at token launch; may be insiders or manipulators |
| **Sniper** | Sniper — bot addresses that automatically buy at the instant of token launch; concentrated holdings may create sell pressure |
| **Aped Wallet** | Wallets that bought large amounts early in a token's life; too many indicates the token is being targeted by bots |
| **Honeypot** | Malicious token contract where you can buy but cannot sell (or sell tax is extremely high) |
| **Slippage** | Difference between expected and actual execution price; worse liquidity means higher slippage |
| **lamports** | Smallest unit of SOL, 1 SOL = 1,000,000,000 lamports |
| **Native SOL** | SOL native token address `11111111111111111111111111111111` (32 ones), must use this address for swap --from |
| **WSOL** | Wrapped SOL (So11...112), SPL Token wrapped form of SOL, cannot be used for swap --from |
